* Seqstats
Seqstats is a small tool written in C on top of the excellent
[[https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib][klib]] library by Heng Li. It
provides general summary statistics of both read and assembly files. It can
read fastq and fasta files, either gzipped or plain.

* Get it!

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/clwgg/seqstats

cd seqstats
make
#+END_SRC

* Usage

You can directly supply seqstats with (gzipped) fasta and fastq files.
If you want to input multiple files, cat-pipe them into seqstats and
use "-" to symbolize to seqstats to read from STDIN.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
seqstats infile.fasta
seqstats infile.fa.gz

seqstats infile.fastq
seqstats infile.fq.gz

cat in1.fq.gz in2.fq.gz > seqstats -
cat chr*.fa > seqstats -
#+END_SRC

List of features and modifications still needed:

General:
    Change all file manipulating functions to deal with sqz_Files instead
        of raw file pointers.
    Add a verbose mode. Current version prints too much.
    General error handling. Currently when errors are detected a log
        is printed. This makes for a clunky api.
        Solution: Create an error member (int) in sqz struct.
                  This can be modified accordingly when an error occurs.
                  Afterwards, a log function can print the right message
                  based on error code.

sqz.c - TODO check for no file overwriting



Code Review
Change sqz_cmp name - To reflect what it does
Change sqz_coding name - sqz_codec

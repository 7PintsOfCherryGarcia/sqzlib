List of features and modifications still needed:

General:
    Add a verbose mode. Current version prints too much.
    General error handling. Currently when errors are detected a log
        is printed. This makes for a clunky api.
        Solution: Create an error member (int) in sqz struct. This can be modified
                  accordingly when an error occurs. Afterwards, a log function can
                  print the right message based on error code.

sqz.c - TODO check for no file overwriting

sqz_kseq.c - TODO handle errors. No error detection implemented yet
             sqz_fastqeblock
              TODO - Fix awkwardness with return value
